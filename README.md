URLTitle
=========

A script for Eggdrop IRC bot that detects URLs from public messages on channels and prints out their title
* .onion URL support added. Requires [tor](https://www.torproject.org/download/download.html.en) and [privoxy](http://sourceforge.net/projects/ijbswa/files/Sources/).

Installation
------------

Just copy urltitle.tcl to your eggdrop scripts directory, set config parameters and add to your Eggdrop configuration file. Works without any configuration, but you can set some options in the script file if you want.
